# FerriteLoader
FerriteLoader is an undetected, indirect, and memory safe rust shellcode injector &amp; executor.

## Features

- **Nt-Based APIs**: FerriteLoader avoids commonly flagged APIs (`VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualProtect`, `CreateRemoteThread`, `WriteProcessMemory`) by dynamically resolving and utilizing their undocumented ntdll.dll based counterparts (`NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtWriteVirtualMemory`, `NtProtectVirtualMemory`, `RtlCreateUserThread`). The use of these lesser-common APIs lower the threat score for the binary as a whole during most forms of analysis.

- **PEB Walking for Dynamic API Resolution**: FerriteLoader locates its most crucial syscalls by traversing the Process Environment Block (PEB) to find function addresses within `ntdll.dll`. This protects/hides its functionality from surface IAT scans, also adding a layer of obscurity during reverse analysis of the binary.

- **Encoded Shellcode Handling**: FerriteLoader uses custom encoding/decoding of the shellcode payload. The included Encode.py script applies a custom charset mapping, additive feedback loop, and XOR encoding to the raw shellcode .bin file (with a user-defined seed). The encoded shellcode is stored in a `.dat` file and embedded as a resource within the binary during compilation, allowing FerriteLoader to decode and inject it only at runtime, minimizing exposure to memory & protecting the payload during static analysis.
- **Virtual Machine Detection**: Using RDTSC CPU instructions, several timing tests are performed and analyzed, any abnormalities deviating from regular 'bare metal' machines will cause FerriteLoader to abort.
- **Gargoyle Technique**: Ferric uses the simple, yet extremely effective 'gargoyle' technique to evade memory scanning of the injected process. This marks the target memory mapped region from R/W/X to R/W just a couple seconds after execution.
- **Stack Strings**: Select strings are not present as contiguous literals in the binary. Instead, they're built from a stack during execution, protecting from static engine detection.
- **Encrypted Strings** Select high-risk strings utilize the goldberg_strings compilation-time protection module to encrypt strings, protecting them from static engine detection, and reverse engineering.
- **Encrypted Integers** Most integers and stored values are also protected with the goldberg_int compilation-time protection module, protecting them from reverse engineering.

- *Note: Obviously this code can be signatured, but I did my best to remove commonalities of shellcode injection.*

## Special Thanks
*A very large special thanks to frank2, who developed the goldberg crate. This helped protect some immediate-use strings, and ints in FerriteLoader.*
